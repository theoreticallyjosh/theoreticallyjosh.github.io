However, it can be a very powerful tool, and even impossible to avoid if you want to program or be involved in IT.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Probably the most recognizable image of the command line is that black box on the screen with green text. Basically it is a place to interact with your computer via text rather than photos (mostly). You&amp;rsquo;ll need an application called a &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;terminal emulator&amp;rdquo; to get started. Also, you will need to select a shell. Think of it as what interprets the text you type, and the terminal displays it. Each operating system has it&amp;rsquo;s own default shell, but for the most part you have at least a few alternatives. There are plenty of articles written on the subject. So, we are just going to look at some high level concepts. In general a command entered into the terminal is broken into 3 parts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
