Companies are racing to add it to everything they can, whether you want it there or not. So, this brings up a lot a questions about how secure our private data really is. Are they using your information to train their AI? Are they selling it? How secure it is? We have already seen case where peoples AI conversations are appearing in Google searches. You might be inclined to just not use or disable AI features, but you may start to fall behind the people who do use these features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clean Data for AI &amp; Automation: Best Practices &amp; Avoiding Automation Failures</title><link>/post/data-cleansing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 09:14:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/data-cleansing/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the first steps to ensure your success when automating a process or using AI in your workflow is to have clean data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-clean-data">What do I mean by clean data?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Clean data is data that can be easily manipulated by software, such as AI, to provide meaningful and accurate results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me tell you about an experience I had with data that wasn&amp;rsquo;t clean. I was tasked with automating the migration of data out of an old billing system into a new one. In the old system, &amp;ldquo;Contracts&amp;rdquo; were stored as free-form data. The client name and the products they purchased were also free-form text. This meant that if &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; originally purchased &amp;ldquo;Product A,&amp;rdquo; and later wanted &amp;ldquo;Product C&amp;rdquo; as well, an additional contract was created. This time the client was listed as &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; with a product called &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; How would you go about determining what the client is contracted for? Well, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much for someone to recognize that &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; are actually the same company. I could have made part of the import process remove common suffixes like &amp;ldquo;LLC&amp;rdquo; when matching everything up. However, everything we sold was a &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; The only way to determine which service was purchased was to hope the salesperson remembered what it was the client bought. This was just one of many problems encountered with the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don’t Ask “How Do We Put AI Into Our Product?” Ask This Instead…</title><link>/post/ai-hammer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 07:15:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/ai-hammer/</guid><description>&lt;p>“How can we put AI into our product?” How many of you have heard or said that recently? With all the hype around AI recently, it’s understandable why. However, it is the wrong question to ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-meant-by-ai">What is meant by AI?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let’s define what we are talking about here. While AI is a broad scope of tools and techniques that have been around for decades, most people, especially in the context mentioned above, mean Large Language Models or LLMs. You know, the ChatGPTs, Google Geminis, and Groks of the world. It is no surprise that LLMs have become the frontman of the AI world. They introduce a huge leap in what we think of AI and how we even define what intelligence means. For many, it’s a magic black box that you type or speak questions into, and get at least on the surface reasonable and human-sounding responses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automation: A Little Time Upfront and Save You Time and Your Sanity</title><link>/post/automate-and-save/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 09:15:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/automate-and-save/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you spend 10-20 minutes every morning just getting started with work? It’s a surprisingly common problem, and it’s costing you valuable time. You’re not alone. Countless professionals struggle with this repetitive routine. The good news is, automation can dramatically change this. It’s not just for large companies. Even a few minutes spent setting up simple automations can save you hours each week.&lt;/p>
