However this need not be the case.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Think about your process every morning when you first log into your computer to work. It may look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Open Outlook&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open a web browser
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigate to your company portal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open a new tab and navigate to other commonly used website(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open your company chat app (Slack, Teams, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the application you use most for work (VS Code, MS Word, MS Excel, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You might say, &amp;ldquo;That only takes a minute, so what?&amp;rdquo; Well, that&amp;rsquo;s one minute every day, maybe more if you do it multiple times. You could spend five minutes writing a script and never have to do all of that again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
