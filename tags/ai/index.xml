&lt;h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-clean-data">What do I mean by clean data?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Clean data is data that can be easily manipulated by software, such as AI, to provide meaningful and accurate results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me tell you about an experience I had with data that wasn&amp;rsquo;t clean. I was tasked with automating the migration of data out of an old billing system into a new one. In the old system, &amp;ldquo;Contracts&amp;rdquo; were stored as free-form data. The client name and the products they purchased were also free-form text. This meant that if &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; originally purchased &amp;ldquo;Product A,&amp;rdquo; and later wanted &amp;ldquo;Product C&amp;rdquo; as well, an additional contract was created. This time the client was listed as &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; with a product called &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; How would you go about determining what the client is contracted for? Well, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much for someone to recognize that &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; are actually the same company. I could have made part of the import process remove common suffixes like &amp;ldquo;LLC&amp;rdquo; when matching everything up. However, everything we sold was a &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; The only way to determine which service was purchased was to hope the salesperson remembered what it was the client bought. This was just one of many problems encountered with the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Hammer</title><link>/post/ai-hammer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 07:15:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/ai-hammer/</guid><description>&lt;p>“How can we put AI into our product?” How many of you have heard or said that recently? With all the hype around AI recently, it’s understandable why. However, it is the wrong question to ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-meant-by-ai">What is meant by AI?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let’s define what we are talking about here. While AI is a broad scope of tools and techniques that have been around for decades, most people, especially in the context mentioned above, mean Large Language Models or LLMs. You know, the ChatGPTs, Google Geminis, and Groks of the world. It is no surprise that LLMs have become the frontman of the AI world. They introduce a huge leap in what we think of AI and how we even define what intelligence means. For many, it’s a magic black box that you type or speak questions into, and get at least on the surface reasonable and human-sounding responses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated the Mundane</title><link>/post/automate-and-save/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 09:15:05 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/automate-and-save/</guid><description>&lt;p>We often think that task automation is reserved for large tasks or companies rather than individuals. However this need not be the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-few-minutes-can-save-you-hours">A Few Minutes Can Save You Hours&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Think about your process every morning when you first log into your computer to work. It may look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Open Outlook&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open a web browser
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigate to your company portal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open a new tab and navigate to other commonly used website(s)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open your company chat app (Slack, Teams, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the application you use most for work (VS Code, MS Word, MS Excel, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You might say, &amp;ldquo;That only takes a minute, so what?&amp;rdquo; Well, that&amp;rsquo;s one minute every day, maybe more if you do it multiple times. You could spend five minutes writing a script and never have to do all of that again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
