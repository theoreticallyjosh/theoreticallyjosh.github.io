&lt;h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-clean-data">What do I mean by clean data?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Clean data is data that can be easily manipulated by software, such as AI, to provide meaningful and accurate results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me tell you about an experience I had with data that wasn&amp;rsquo;t clean. I was tasked with automating the migration of data out of an old billing system into a new one. In the old system, &amp;ldquo;Contracts&amp;rdquo; were stored as free-form data. The client name and the products they purchased were also free-form text. This meant that if &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; originally purchased &amp;ldquo;Product A,&amp;rdquo; and later wanted &amp;ldquo;Product C&amp;rdquo; as well, an additional contract was created. This time the client was listed as &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; with a product called &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; How would you go about determining what the client is contracted for? Well, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much for someone to recognize that &amp;ldquo;Client A&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Client A LLC&amp;rdquo; are actually the same company. I could have made part of the import process remove common suffixes like &amp;ldquo;LLC&amp;rdquo; when matching everything up. However, everything we sold was a &amp;ldquo;Service.&amp;rdquo; The only way to determine which service was purchased was to hope the salesperson remembered what it was the client bought. This was just one of many problems encountered with the data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
